## 1. Flask-based RESTful API:
 - I first made a [```app_basic.py```](https://github.com/Helzheng123/flask_6_api_management/blob/main/app_basic.py) file along with an [```app_flasgger.py```](https://github.com/Helzheng123/flask_6_api_management/blob/main/app_flasgger.py) file. In each, I made a home page and a hello page.
 - In the Home page, I only included a "Hello" response.
 - In the Hello page, I included:
    - Name (upper case)
    - Last name (upper case)
    - Birthday
